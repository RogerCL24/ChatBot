# CHATBOT 

## DOCUMENTATION üìç

### OpenAI API
We visit the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) web page, then we log and go to Manage Account > Usage, we will see that we have _$18.00_ <sub> If you sign up before 2023 </sub> or _$5.00_ <sub> Otherwise </sub> for a free trial usage:

</p>

If you want to keep paying in order to use more the api you can go to [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) and check the fees. For example, the most advanced up to now, GPT-4 -> 
- Depending on the context amount we have different fees, in the 8K context model they will charge you _$0.03_ for each 1K tokens of prompt/input and _$0.06_ for each 1K tokens of answer/ouput. <sub> Tokens are explained at [Chatbot background](https://github.com/RogerCL24/ChatBot)

</p>

In this chatbot we are going to use the `Fine-tuning models`, they are models already created and we only have to train them with our own data, therefore we are fine-tuning their base model.
- There are 4 models, the more expensive the more performance it has.

### LangChain

With this framework we can integrate a library in charge to use the OpenAI API and connect it to the following library.‚¨áÔ∏è <sub> More info [https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) </sub>

### GPT index

With this library we can supply new data to _LangChain_ in order to transform that data into the embeddings needed that will be consumed by the OpenAI API. <sub> More info [https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)</sub>

### Gradio

Finally, _Gradio_ can generate interfaces to interact with trained models with a few code lines, dependending on the complexity of the interface that we want. <sub> More info [https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart) </sub>

## SETUP üìç

We are going to be using the _Jupyter_ notebooks at VScode to implement the chatbot.

### Virtual environment
In this case we selected venv of python to create the virtual environment, you can use anaconda in your cmd as well, but the following commands will differ.

- Create the workspace and the directory which you are going to create the virtual environment, then use this prompt in VScode cmd to create the venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv virtual_env_name
```
- Now, to activate it:
```bash
source virtual_env_name/bin/activate
```
Fine, now we go with the libraries:

```bash
pip install openai
pip install gradio
pip install gpt-index
pip install langchain
```
And also we are going to need another library in our virtual environment if we want to use this venv as a kernel where our files are going to be executed over.

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=kernel_name
```

Finally we create a `.ipynb` file in the same directory as the venv, <sub> You need to install _Jupyter_ extension from microsoft if you do not have it already </sub>, then we select the virtual environment where the file is going to be executed at `Select kernel` <sub> Upper right corner </sub>, we will select _Python Environments_ -> and see the venv named **kernel_name** <sub> from the former code </sub>.

## API requests üìç
In order to try the API's requests we have to create an API key first, therefore we log at the OpenAI web page, then here [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and finally we create a new key which we have to copy and paste it at `<API-KEY>` gap.

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "<API-KEY>"

chatbot = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-003",
                                   prompt="What is ChatGPT?",
                                   max_tokens=2048)
print(chatbot.choices[0].text)
```
Basically we are creating an instance, `chatbot` var. Now we use the ``openai`` library -> then we use the task `Completion` (output) and `create` -> and finally we specify an engine `text-davinci-003` <sub> Check all models [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits) </sub>, the prompt (input) `What is ChatGPT?` and the limit of tokens (words) of the answer `2048`. At last we print it, you can see the answer of this code execution at [chat.ipynb](https://github.com/RogerCL24/ChatBot/blob/main/CHATBOT/chat.ipynb).

Now let's do the same but through the console and with any prompt to make sure it works.
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "<API-KEY>"

while True:

    prompt=input("\n Send a message: ")
    
    if prompt == 'Leave' or prompt == 'leave':
        break

    chatbot = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-003",
                                    prompt=prompt,
                                    max_tokens=2048)

    print(chatbot.choices[0].text)
```
Same as before but with an infinite loop and an input var.
- Example:

</p>

## Frontend with Gradio üìç
Gradio will allow us to create an easy coded web page where we can use our chatbot, but first let's see how it works with a little example: 
```python
import gradio as gr

def greeting(name,daylight,farenheit_temp):
    greeting = "Good morning" if daylight == True else "Good night"
    temperature = round((farenheit_temp-32)*5/9)
    greetings = f"{greeting} {name}. Today's temperature is {temperature} Celsius degrees"
    return greetings
    

app = gr.Interface(fn=greeting,
                   inputs=["text","checkbox", gr.Slider(0,120)],
                   outputs="text")

app.launch()
```
We define a var as `app` which is an interface (``gradio`` library and ``Interface`` object), `Interface` has 3 parameters:
- **Function (fn)**: In this case `greeting`, which has at the same time 3 parameters and returns a text.
- **inputs**: The inputs for the `greeting` function.
- **outputs**: The ouput from the `greeting` function.

When we execute this code at the console it will print a link, we click it `Ctrl+left_click` and then it will redirect us to a local host with the web page formerly implemented:
